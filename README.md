# Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on building a Breast Cancer Detection system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes input medical data, such as tumor characteristics, to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. It leverages supervised learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions and assist in early cancer diagnosis.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes features, and prepares data for analysis.

- Machine Learning Models: Implements classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

- Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Visualization: Generates graphs and charts to display data distribution and model performance.

- User Interface: Simple interface for data input and prediction display.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

## Performance Metrics
